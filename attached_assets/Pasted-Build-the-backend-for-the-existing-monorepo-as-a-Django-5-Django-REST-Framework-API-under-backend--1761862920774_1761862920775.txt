Build the backend for the existing monorepo as a Django 5 + Django REST Framework API under backend/ and leave the frontend untouched. Read all secrets from Replit Secrets only. Use Supabase Postgres as the only database. Steps: create project backend with app core; add requirements.txt containing Django 5, djangorestframework, dj-database-url, psycopg[binary], django-cors-headers, PyJWT. In settings.py, configure DB with dj_database_url.config(env="DATABASE_URL") and hard-fail on startup with ImproperlyConfigured if the scheme is sqlite or the hostname does not match a Supabase host (*.supabase.co), per project rules. Add CORS via django-cors-headers; read CORS_ORIGIN (CSV) and ALLOWED_HOSTS from env. Expose GET /api/v1/health/db which executes SELECT 1; return 200 on success, 503 on failure.

First deliverable = User management & auth: implement a custom User (email as username) with fields: email (unique), password, first_name, last_name, role ∈ {ADMIN, MANAGER, TL, SRMGR, EMPLOYEE}, optional team FK. Use a manager so we can create users by email; enable admin site. Add JWT endpoints under /api/v1/auth/: POST /login (email+password → access/refresh using DJANGO_SECRET_KEY, JWT_ACCESS_SECRET, JWT_REFRESH_SECRET), POST /refresh, POST /logout (invalidate refresh via a simple denylist table). Create a management command seed_demo that idempotently inserts one team and three users with password demo123: admin@example.com (ADMIN), manager@example.com (MANAGER), employee@example.com (EMPLOYEE).

Scaffold the minimal schema (models, serializers, viewsets; simple DRF permissions) we’ll flesh out later: Teams; Courses {title, description, video_url, thumbnail_url, status ∈ {draft,published}, created_by}; Resources (normalized Google Doc/Slides/PDF viewer links only); Assignments {user, course, status, progress_pct, last_activity_at}; ProgressEvent {assignment, pct, at}; Notifications {user, text, read_at}; Approval {course, requested_by (TL|MANAGER), approved_by (SRMGR nullable), note, status ∈ {pending,approved,rejected}}. Enforce that only ADMIN can publish OR a course with an approved Approval may be set to published. Add DRF routes under /api/v1/: /courses (list/create/update/retrieve), /assignments/mine, /assignments/team (manager), /assignments/{id}/progress (PATCH), /notifications (list/mark-read). Add /dashboards/admin and /dashboards/manager with simple computed counts from the current tables (static-friendly for now).

Repo/run wiring: add preflight.sh at repo root that exits non-zero if DATABASE_URL is missing, contains sqlite, or if any migration mentions non-Postgres adapters; hook Replit backend run to python manage.py check && python manage.py migrate && python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000. After migrations, run python manage.py seed_demo. Do not add any storage SDKs or upload endpoints; media are links only (YouTube embeds, Google viewers). Keep a concise README at repo root listing required secrets: DATABASE_URL, DJANGO_SECRET_KEY, JWT_ACCESS_SECRET, JWT_REFRESH_SECRET, CORS_ORIGIN, ALLOWED_HOSTS (and optional POSTHOG_KEY for the existing frontend).

Use this DATABASE_URL in Replit Secrets (percent-encode reserved characters first):
postgresql://postgres.rtkztksajehvdpzdksgx:aRZe%3F%2B7-AyXY%2B9y@aws-1-ap-southeast-1.pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres
Deliverables: committed backend code under /backend, migrations applied, seed_demo created users, and working endpoints /api/v1/health/db and /api/v1/auth/login.
