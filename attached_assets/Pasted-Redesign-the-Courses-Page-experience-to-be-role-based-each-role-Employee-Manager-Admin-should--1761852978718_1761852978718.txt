Redesign the Courses Page experience to be role-based — each role (Employee, Manager, Admin) should see and interact with courses differently while keeping navigation and styling consistent with the rest of the platform.

🧑‍🎓 Employee View (Learner Experience)

Purpose: The employee can browse assigned or available courses and continue learning.
Layout and behavior:

Header: “My Courses” with search bar.

Display course cards in a clean grid with thumbnail, title, short description, and progress bar.

Buttons:

View (opens Course View page).

Continue (if in progress) or Start Course (if not started).

Badges: “Completed,” “In Progress,” or “Not Started.”

No Create, Assign, Publish, or Approve actions visible.

Tooltip under each card: “Assigned by [Manager Name].”

👩‍💼 Manager View (Course Creator & Assigner Experience)

Purpose: The manager can create new courses and assign them to their team but cannot publish or approve them.
Layout and behavior:

Header: “My Courses” with “Create Course” button on the right.

Course cards include: thumbnail, title, description, creator, and status badge (“Draft,” “Awaiting Approval,” “Published”).

Buttons:

View (preview course).

Assign (opens Assign modal to choose employees).

Edit (only for drafts).

If a course is in Draft, show a gray “Draft” badge and a disabled Publish button with tooltip “Pending Admin Approval.”

If Published, show green “Published” badge and disable editing.

If Awaiting Approval, show yellow badge “Awaiting Admin Review.”

👨‍💼 Admin View (Reviewer & Publisher Experience)

Purpose: The admin can review manager drafts, approve and publish them, and view platform-wide course data.
Layout and behavior:

Header: “All Courses” with filters by status: Draft / Awaiting Approval / Published.

Each course card shows thumbnail, title, creator, and metadata (level, updated date).

Buttons:

View (preview course).

Approve & Publish (active only for draft or awaiting approval courses).

Reject (opens modal to leave feedback).

Published courses show green “Published” badge.

Rejected ones show red “Needs Revision.”

Optionally include a small “Created by [Manager]” label to trace ownership.

🔁 Experience Consistency

Keep the same grid, typography, and hover interactions for all roles.

Role-based visibility: buttons, badges, and tooltips differ per role.

Maintain visual unity across all pages so switching roles feels cohesive, not like separate apps.

When the backend is later added, visibility and access control will connect directly to each user’s role.

This ensures that Employees learn, Managers create and assign, and Admins review and publish — giving each a clear, frictionless experience within the same platform.
