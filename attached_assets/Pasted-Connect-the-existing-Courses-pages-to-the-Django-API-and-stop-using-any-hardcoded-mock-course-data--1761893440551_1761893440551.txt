Connect the existing Courses pages to the Django API and stop using any hardcoded/mock course data. Keep the repo structure and all current routes, components, and UI exactly as they are; only add the API layer and replace the data source. Backend expectations: /api/v1/courses/ returns an array of courses with fields { id, title, description, thumbnail_url, video_url, status, created_by_name, duration_minutes, level, updated_at }; the endpoint requires Authorization: Bearer <accessToken>; CORS is already configured via env; login flow already returns access and refresh tokens. Frontend tasks: 1) Add a tiny API client that reads VITE_API_BASE_URL from env and attaches Authorization: Bearer <accessToken> to requests; centralize in src/api/client.ts. 2) Create src/api/courses.ts exporting fetchCourses(token) and the CourseDto type that matches the backend fields. 3) Update the Courses listing screen(s) to load with useEffect → fetchCourses(accessToken); show loading and error states; remove all imports/usages of src/mocks/courses (do not delete the file). 4) Role-aware filtering on the client (until server filters are added): EMPLOYEE → show only status === "published"; MANAGER → show published plus manager’s own drafts; ADMIN → show all; keep existing card/buttons but ensure MANAGER cannot see approve/publish controls and ADMIN can. 5) Keep search and tabs working, but filter the API list in memory. 6) Ensure clicking a card still routes to /courses/:id; the details page may continue using placeholder content unless /api/v1/courses/{id} exists—if it does, fetch and render it the same way. 7) Read the JWT access token and user role from the existing auth store (do not change the login or token storage logic); if no token, redirect to /login as today. 8) Add .env.example with VITE_API_BASE_URL= (value intentionally blank); do not hardcode any host/port in code. 9) Verify: after signing in, the Courses page makes a single GET ${VITE_API_BASE_URL}/courses/ with the Bearer token; the grid renders only real courses from the backend per role; no mock data remains. 10) Commit changes and print which files were modified.
