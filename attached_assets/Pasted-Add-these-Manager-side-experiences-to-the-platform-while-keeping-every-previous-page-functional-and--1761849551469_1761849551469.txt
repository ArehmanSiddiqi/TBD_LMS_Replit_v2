Add these Manager-side experiences to the platform while keeping every previous page functional and linked (Login, Dashboards, Course View/Create, Employee pages). Focus on user experience and flow, not backend logic.

1. Manager “My Team” Page
Shows all team members in clean cards, each with name, role, and progress summary (“2 assigned”, “1 completed”).
Every card includes three actions:

Assign → opens the “Assign Course” modal.

Progress → opens a detailed view (placeholder for now).

View Profile → opens that employee’s summary (placeholder).
At the top-right, show a button “Add Team Member”. Searching in the bar filters the visible list live.

2. “Assign Course” Modal
Triggered from any Assign button.
Title: “Assign Course to Employees.”
Subtitle: “Select employees to assign this course to.”
Show the selected course title.
List all employees with avatar initials, name, and role.
Already assigned employees show a light tag “Already assigned.”
Each entry has a checkbox; selecting updates a live count at the bottom (“3 employee(s) selected”).
Bottom buttons: primary Assign to X Employee(s) (disabled if 0 selected), secondary Cancel (closes modal).

3. Manager “Employee Management” Page
Header: “Employee Management” and subtitle “View all employees and send invitations.”
Search bar filters employees.
Each employee card shows avatar initials, name, role, and three small badges to the right — “2 assigned,” “1 in progress,” “1 completed.”
Top-right button: Invite Employee, which opens the invite modal below.

4. “Invite Employee” Modal
Title: “Invite Employee.”
Subtitle: “Send an invitation to join the Taleemabad University L&D platform.”
Fields: Full Name, Email Address.
Buttons: primary Send Invitation (no logic yet, just feedback placeholder), secondary Cancel.

Behavior summary

Assign and Invite modals appear centered with blurred overlay and close on outside click or X.

All lists and counts use static dummy data.

Search filters update lists immediately (visual only).

Buttons, badges, and colors follow the Figma’s look.

Navigation must let a manager move between Dashboard → Courses → My Team → Employees without losing state or layout consistency.

Ensure all hover, focus, and modal transitions feel smooth and consistent across the platform.
