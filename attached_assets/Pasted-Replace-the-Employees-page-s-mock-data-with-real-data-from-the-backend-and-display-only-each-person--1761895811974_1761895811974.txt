Replace the Employees page’s mock data with real data from the backend and display only each person’s name, designation, and email. Keep all routing, components, and modals intact; do not change login, tokens, or other pages.

Backend

Add a read-only endpoint GET /api/v1/employees/ that returns an array of:

[{ "id": 1, "name": "Ali Hassan", "email": "ali@taleemabad.com", "designation": "Content Developer" }]


– If User doesn’t have a designation field, add job_title = models.CharField(max_length=120, blank=True) and expose it as designation in the serializer; for name, return get_full_name() (fallback to email local-part).
– Permission: MANAGER and ADMIN only (EMPLOYEE should get 403).
– Add optional ?q= search (matches name or email).
– Update seed_demo to set titles for demo users (e.g., “Content Developer”, “UI/UX Designer”).
– Wire the route in DRF as /api/v1/employees/ (don’t break existing /users/ if present).
– CORS/hosts remain from env; authentication via Authorization: Bearer <access>.

Frontend
2) Create src/api/employees.ts:

export type Employee = { id:number; name:string; email:string; designation:string };

export async function fetchEmployees(token:string, q?:string): Promise<Employee[]> using VITE_API_BASE_URL.

Update the Employees page (e.g., src/pages/EmployeesPage.tsx):

Remove all imports/usages of mock employees and progress/assignment counts.

On mount, call fetchEmployees(accessToken, q); keep a controlled search input that refetches on change (debounce 250ms).

Render simple cards showing:

Avatar initials

Name (bold)

Designation (secondary line)

Email (small text)

Delete/Hide the badges (“assigned / in progress / completed”) and any mock counters.

Keep the “Invite Employee” button and modal UI, but no backend send is required yet (no-op).

UX details:

Loading state: skeleton cards (6 placeholders).

Empty state: “No employees found.”

Errors: small inline alert with retry.

Do not add or change any ports in code; read VITE_API_BASE_URL from env; attach the Bearer token from the existing auth store.

Verification:

After sign-in as MANAGER or ADMIN, the Employees page calls GET /api/v1/employees/ once and renders only name/designation/email from the database.

EMPLOYEE role navigating to /employees receives 403 and should see the existing protected-route behavior.

Finally, commit the changes and list modified files.
